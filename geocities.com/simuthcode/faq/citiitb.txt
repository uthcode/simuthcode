For S/W persons test is as follows.
        There are two sections each containg 40 questions.One arthematic
and another is reasoning. In arthematic 11 are data sufficiency and 8 are
anology.In reasoning all are puzzle type. Probably he rejects very
few from test , since after that GD follows. Any I am sending some q's as for
as my rememberance.
                Arthematic
1) Hypothesis :problem (below 4 he will give)

11)data sufficiency  p>q?
        1)p,q positive
        2)q-1=q*2+p
This type you can see in GMAT book.
        Reasoning
1)      ABCDEF attended for an interview, in which 3 were selected
A is worst of the lot
C got equal marks as F(C=F)
D<F and G

E is not selected
B>C
There are 5 questions below this.
2)There are 7 fellows sat in the following way
C and F always sit as a apart as follows
No. of fellows sat b/w c and D and D and F are equal like that he has given
Ans: Order is as follows C E B D A G F by using this you can answer all
About 4 to 5 are there
3)ABCDE are five brothers. There are twins(only one pair of equal age)
both are neither younger nor older. D is younger to 3 brothers.
B is older than E and C.
q's like who is youngest? Eldest ? About 4 are there.
4)A person has meet a king for that ha has to cross 7 gates. At each gate he
has to pay half the amount he is carrying. Finally he gave Rs 3/- to the
king. Then the amount he carried at the beginning and some questions
(about 5)like that.
5) Heros tell truth and cowards lie.There PQR three persons. P tells Q "I
may be hero or I may be coward". Q tells R "P was telling that he was
coward. Then R tells Q "P was not a coward but he was a hero". You better
study the question it may not be entirely correct.
In thus 3 q"s are there

If want to go for hardcore there wont"be any  test direct GD and interview
